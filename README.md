## What did I use to build?

This is the list of technologies I used to build this project and what each one is for:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Is superset of JavaScript that provides type checking, makes easier to find errors, which results in a more robust code base;
- [Astro](https://astro.build/): JS/TS framework to create components and generate the pages;
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework to build the design;
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): Component library for Tailwind CSS to make a little less verbose;
- [astro-iconify](https://github.com/manuelmeister/astro-iconify): Icon pack for Astro, powered by [Iconify](https://iconify.design/);
